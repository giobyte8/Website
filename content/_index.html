        <h2>Career overview</h2>

        <h4 class="mt-3">2019</h4>
        <p>
            During September of 2019 I joined Encora as a software engineer, I have to
            say Encora help me to take my career to the next level. I grew up a lot as a
            person and improved my soft skills. I figured out that software engineering
            is more about people than about code
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the most valuable lessons I've learned are:
            <ul>
                <li>Taking a break is part of the job</li>
                <li>Dedicate time to personal life, it is the most valuable resource</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid of failure, fail fast, learn the lesson and get over</li>
                <li>Teamwork</li>
                <li>Be yourself, that's the best version of you</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>2018</h4>
        <p>
            In January 2018 I co-founded a software development company. It was a
            big challenge for me. I had to learn quite skills such as project
            management, team work, team leading, effective communication, projects
            planning and costs estimations
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately it went fine, even better than expected to be honest.
        </p>

        <h4>2015</h4>
        <p>
            During June of 2015 I got my first job as software developer at a local
            agency. I worked there during three years creating web applications with
            multiple web frameworks such as Laravel, Django and Spring boot, and mobile
            app for android devices. In addition to it, I had the opportunity to
            coordinate a team to implement git, gitlab and docker as part of our
            workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned a lot during those years and had the opportunity to implement
            several ideas and concepts to improve the quality of our products and
            workflow.
        </p>

        <h4>2013</h4>
        <p>
            During december of 2013 I went into my first end to end side project. It
            was a web application to play multimedia content directly from multiple
            cloud storage providers such as Microsoft OneDrive (Skydrive at that time),
            Google Drive and Dropbox, something similar to Spotify/Youtube but private
            and with your own media. At that moment a lor of concepts were new for me,
            I had to learn about REST Services, APIs, OAuth authentication, Http
            protocol, Http security, Scheduled jobs and frameworks for frontend
            development.
            
            <br>
            Although the final version of the app was not perfect, it was a great
            achievement for me and a motivator for upcoming years and projects.
        </p>

        <h4>2010</h4>
        <p>
            I started to write code at university during 2010, it was my first contact
            with computer science and I really liked. I was curious and eager to learn
            since I was a kid, so it matched perfectly for me
